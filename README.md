# 🚀 Welcome to Vyomkesh_Bakshi_App i.e.  **Tracking App** ...... ahem.....Stalking...🚀 I mean, **Tracking** made Easy!


## 🤔 What's this App All About?
So, you want to know everything about someone just because they clicked a link you sent them? Of course you do. This app is here to help you unleash your inner Vyomkesh Bakshi or Sherlock Holmes! 🕵️‍♂️

No more guessing! Now, with the **Tracking App**, you can *casually* spy—I mean, gather **important user information** like their IP address, location, and whether they prefer pineapples on pizza. 🍍🍕 (Ok, maybe not the pizza part, but still... it’s cool, right?)

## 🚨 But Wait... Is This Legal? 🤨
Well... uh... technically, we only track **public** information. You know, stuff that people are already sharing with the world. So yeah, it's totally legit. 😅 Just don’t use it to do anything **illegal**... or we'll have to pretend we don’t know you.


## 😎 Features:
- **IP Address Tracking**: We know where you live! (Just kidding, only your IP address... for now 👀)
- **Geolocation**: Ever wanted to know where someone is without them knowing? Well, now you can. And it's totally not creepy, trust us. 🌍
- **Unique Links for Each Vict... Uh, I Mean User**: Send them custom links and *magically* gather their info when they click! It's like magic, but creepier. 🎩✨
- **Beautiful Django Admin Panel**: So sleek, you’ll wonder if you accidentally launched Facebook. (But not really. It’s just Django, after all.)

## 🤯 How Does It Work?

1. **Generate a Tracking Link**: You click a button, we give you a shiny new link. Simple, right? Like a dog fetching a stick, but more digital.
2. **Share the Link**: Send it to your friends, enemies, or that person who keeps leaving you on read.
3. **Sit Back and Enjoy**: Watch as the information pours in. You’ll be tracking IPs like a pro hacker in a movie—minus the cool soundtrack and Matrix-like visuals.

## 🚨 But Wait... Is This Legal? 🤨
Well... uh... technically, we only track **public** information. You know, stuff that people are already sharing with the world. So yeah, it's totally legit. 😅 Just don’t use it to do anything **illegal**... or we'll have to pretend we don’t know you.

## 🛠️ Installation Instructions:
Follow these simple steps, or call a developer if you prefer Netflix to coding:

1. **Clone the repo** (because that's what all cool devs do):

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/sachnaror/tracking_app.git
   ```

**2. Install the requirements (Python’s favorite snack):**

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt

   ```

**3.	Migrate the database (Django loves a good migration):**


   ```
   python manage.py migrate

   ```


**4.	Run the server and become a digital tracking mastermind:**


   ```
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

**5.	Optional: Add a tinfoil hat to your outfit for extra hacker vibes. 🧢**


**🕵️‍♂️ Tracking in Action**

Once the app is up and running, here’s how you track someone (again, totally not creepy):

	1.	Generate a unique link.
	2.	Send it to your “target” (don’t tell them it tracks their IP… that’s a buzzkill).
	3.	Once they click, visit the admin panel, and BOOM! You now know their city, location, and favorite ice cream flavor. 🍦

🧑‍💻 **Example Usage**

```
    def track_user(request, unique_id):
    ip_address = request.META.get('REMOTE_ADDR', '')
    # Behold, the magical moment when you become an all-seeing eye. 👁️

```

🚨 **Warning**

	•	This app will NOT make you Batman. 🦇 Sorry. We tried.
	•	Don’t use this to track your ex. That’s a whole other set of problems. 💔

🎉 **Contributing**

Do you have the urge to add even more crazy features? Want to track more than just IP addresses? Fork away, my friend! Make sure you add fun comments and jokes in the code because life’s too short for boring code. 🤓

🙌 **Special Thanks**

	•	To Django, for making web development bearable.
	•	To Python, for being our favorite snake.
	•	And to the internet, for providing endless cat videos while we procrastinate on our real work. 🐱
